# CitySmashVR
City destruction game demo for HTC Vive. The game serves as a demo for playing with VR game creation.
The goal is to have a fully destructable environment and allow the player to scale themselves up and down to interact with the environment.



Currently only a few blocks exist and some of the structures are not fully destroyable. Bombs shown here can level a block. Click the gif below for the gfycat version.

Pathfinding is currently using waypoints that are baked into the navigation mesh. In the future it may be altered. Once you interact with an object currently it stops its pathfinding routines. Click the gif below for the gfycat version.
